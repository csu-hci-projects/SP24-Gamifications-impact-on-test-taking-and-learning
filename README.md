# SP24-Gamifications-Impact-On-Test-Taking-and-Learning

## Contributions:
### Sawyer
For the research paper portion, I contributed to writing some of the Introduction, as well as writing the entire Methodology section. I also spent a lot of time working on ensuring the formatting of the paper was correct and it was citing all sources properly.
For the coding section, I focused on writing python that was the back end of the code. To run my section, simply type 'python3 main.py' into the command line and it begins!

## Meeting Times
We have been using teams to communicate with one another, and have been meeting every Saturday to make a call, and some additional calls were made whenever neccessary.
