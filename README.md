#### Authors: Sawyer Parker and Zhaoying Song

### Downloads Necessary
Python version 3.12.3
Pygame version 2.5.2
Pandas version 2.2.2
Those should all be the most up to date version of that software

### How to compile the code
In the command line, navigate to the project directory that holds the data directory, and all python files. <br>
On Windows type: "**py main.py**" or some variation of that into the command line. <br>
On Linux type: "**python main.py**" or "**python3 main.py**" or some variation of that into the command line. <br>
These should be valid options to run the application, but if those dont work you simply need a way to compile the main.py file with python. <br>

### How to navigate the app
The app takes user input from the keyboard exclusively. When prompted to select an answer each option will appear by a number. <br>
Type that number, it should appear in a grey box at the bottom of the application, then hit enter. <br>
Other detailed instructions on what input the app expects to take are provided to the user in the application. <br>
To exit the code, when in the main menu you can close the application window or hit the ESC key. <br>
