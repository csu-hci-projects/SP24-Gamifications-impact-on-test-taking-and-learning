## Contributions:
### Sawyer
For the research paper portion, I contributed to writing some of the Introduction, as well as writing the entire Methodology section. I also spent a lot of time working on ensuring the formatting of the paper was correct and it was citing all sources properly.
For the coding section, I focused on writing python that was the back end of the code. To run my section, simply type 'python3 main.py' into the command line and it begins!
### Zhaoying
In this research paper, I wrote the Introduction with Sawyer, and I looked up online for all the sources we need for our paper, and wrote the introductions of each of the sources. In the code, I was writing the front end of the code, which includes a simple visual of the studying flashcards, the adding flash cards questions and answer feature. To run the front end, if on windows, type start index.html, if on linux, type open index.html

## Future Work:
As of right now, we have divided the group into Sawyer working on the back end, and Zhaoying working on the front end.
